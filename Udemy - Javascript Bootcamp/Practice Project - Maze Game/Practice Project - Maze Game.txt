Practice Project - Maze Game
https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/learn/lecture/17006362#questions

Challenges
1- Create a maze
There are many algorithms to generate a maze. We'll have to learn a bit about tree data structure and recursion to implement the simplest algorithm.

2- Draw maze on the screen
Use Matter JS to draw the maze onto a canvas element (brm.io/matter.js)

3- Use keys to control the ball
Matter JS has the ability to map key presses to movements of shapes

4- Detect if player reached the maze goal
Matter JS has the ability to detect collisions between different shapes and report them to us as events 

Matter JS
- a 2D rigid body physics engine for the web.
Terminology
- World: object that contains all of the different 'things' in our matter app.
- Engine: reads in the current state of the world from the world object, then calculates changes in positions of all the different shapes.
- Runner: gets the engine and world to work together, and runs about 60 times per second.
- Render: whenever the engine processes an update, render will take a look at all the different shapes and show them on the screen.
Body: A shape that we are displaying, and can be a circle, rectangle, oval, etc.
