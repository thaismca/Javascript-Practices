Create a page to simulate a credit card form.

Page must have a form to receive the following input from user:
- card number: 16 digits length and only numbers;
- cardholder name: string that is always displayed in upper case and
doesn't accept special characters or numbers;
- expiry date: select month and select year;
- CVV: 3 digits and only numbers.

Page must exibith a card-like rectangle, where the card number,
cardholder name, expiry date and cvv number that are displayed are
in sync with what the user is typing in the form below.

Rectangle representing the card must flip to display its front or back,
depending on the input that has focus at the moment.

Data being typed in the inputs should be displayed with no mask, and
the representation of this data in the card-like rectangle must be
as the following:

- card number must display the eight digits in the middle of the card
number as #### ####, and only display the first four and last four
digits with no mask;
- cardholder name: displayed in upper case, just as in the form input;
- expiry date: date in format MM/YY;
- CVV: display typed data masked with dots.

Submit button will only be available once all data is typed, following
the these rules:
- card number must have 16 digits
- CVV must have 3 digits
- card cannot be expired

Clicking submit will display a "order confirmed" without loading
a new page.
