# Testing Automation

Goals of automated testing:
- automate the process of ensuring that our app works as we expect
- keep us from having to manually click around the app to find bugs
- make sure the app still works as expected even after we change something

This section was broken down in 3 parts, each one with the following goals:

## Part 1
- write a tiny node project -> Hidash
- figure out how to test it without any outside testing library
- test it using a testing library

## Part 2
- take a look at a previous project that was built in this bootcamp
- test it using a testing library

## Part 3
- write a custom testing framework that will work in about 80% of all projects
