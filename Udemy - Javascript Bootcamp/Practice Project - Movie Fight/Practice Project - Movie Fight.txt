Challenges:
1 - Fetch data about movies
Free API for getting movie data: omdbapi.com
We are going to have to do initially a search to find some records that match the user search term, and then a follow up request to get information about a particular movie that the user selected. This means we are going to use both available endpoints in the API.

By Search: to list movies in the autocomplete widget that matches whatever the user types in the search input.
By ID: to get more details about the movie that the user selects from th list of options in the autocomplete widget.

2 - Build autocomplete widget from scratch
