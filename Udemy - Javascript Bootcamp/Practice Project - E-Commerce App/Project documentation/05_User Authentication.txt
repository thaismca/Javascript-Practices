>>>> USER SIGNUP

Signup validation logic will be implemented as following:

1. If another user already signed up with this email, show an error.
Only one unique email will be allowed for each user.

2. If password and password confirmation are different, show an error.
Password confirmation must match the password.

If no errors are encountered, create an account for the user.
