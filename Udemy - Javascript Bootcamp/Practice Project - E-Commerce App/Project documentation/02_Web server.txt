>>>>> EXPRESS
A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Documentation: https://expressjs.com/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Getting started
  - install package: npm install express
  - get access to the express package inside of the project: const express = require('express');
  - instantiate an object that describes all the different thing that the web server can do: const app = express();

We are going to customize this object to tell the web server what kind of requests it should expect to receive, and what it should do whenever it does receive a request.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Basic routing
Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on). Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

Route definition takes the following structure: app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
  - app is an instance of express
  - METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase
  - PATH is a path on the server
  - HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched

The HANDLER is a callback function that's always called with the two same arguments: req and res.
  - req: object that represents the incoming request from a browser into the web server
  - res: object that represents the outgoing response from the server back to the browser

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Accessing app from a browser
In order to have the app being accessed from a browser, it's necessary to tell the application to start listening for incoming network traffic on a particular port.

app.listen(path, [callback]): Starts a UNIX socket and listens for connections on the given path.

In our case, path will be the port 3000. Once both a basic routing and this listener are set up, navigate to 'localhost:3000' in the browser to access the app from there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Writing and using middleware
Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
 - Execute any code.
 - Make changes to the request and the response objects.
 - End the request-response cycle.
 - Call the next middleware in the stack.

The middleware function is always called with three arguments:
 - req: request object
 - res: response object
 - next: callback argument to the middleware function

Inside of the middleware function, we can run some amout of code to inspect and modify the req and res objects. If we do so, those modifications are going to show up inside of our later request handler that receives the same req and res objects when next is executed. After all processing of req and res is done by the middleware function, we need to  call the next function, which is essentially the sign that the middleware is all done processing, and that Express can continue and run whatever function needs to be ran.

It's possible to set a given middleware to be called for all the different route handlers.
 - app.use(middlewareFunction);

This eliminates the need of adding a call for that middleware function in every single request handler.
