>>>>> USER-FACING FEATURES

In this project, the user should have the ability to perform the following actions:
- see a list of products
- click to add a product to the cart
- click to see a summary of all the products that are currently in the shopping cart
- remove a product from the shopping cart
- click to buy the products

Handlers that we are going to need:
- list all different products
- 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>> PRODUCTS LISTING

Displaying the list of products:
- It will be handled as a GET request to '/'
- It will be the central page of the project (landing page)
- Display a list of the existing products, each entry containing product's name, price, image and a "add to cart" button.
- Display a Cart button 

To display list of products:
- use getAll method to get a list of all the products in the products repository
- create a view that will list out all those different products (index)
- get this view to be displayed when a GET request is made to '/'

Clicking the Add to Cart button for a given product will add that product to the cart. Each product can be added multiple times, and that's accounted for in the cart total. Clicking the Cart will allow user to the the cart summary.
