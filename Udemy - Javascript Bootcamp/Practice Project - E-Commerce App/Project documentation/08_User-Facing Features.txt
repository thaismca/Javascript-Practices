This document contains more details about user-facing features of the "Practice Project - E-Commerce App"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>>>> USER-FACING FEATURES

In this project, the user should have the ability to perform the following actions:
- see a list of products
- click to add a product to the cart
- click to see a summary of all the products that are currently in the shopping cart
- remove a product from the shopping cart
- click to buy the products

NOTE: the buy action in this project will only show a success message and clear the cart

Handlers that we are going to need:
- list all different products
- 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>> REUSABLE LAYOUT

Same as we currently have for the admin related features, the HTML generation will be placed into some different files that are going to be placed inside of the Views directory. The idea is to have a bunch of different files inside of this new directory, each one being responsible for returning one little snippet of HTML.

These snippets will be added to the body of a reusable layout, that will contain all the HTML that can be shared across all user-facing pages of the application.

Note that this layout will have some content that is not really useful, such as the header with the phone number and social media icons, and the promo banner. They are only being added to give to whoever sees this project a sense of visiting an e-commerce page.

>>>> PRODUCTS LISTING

Displaying the list of products:
- It will be handled as a GET request to '/'
- It will be the central page of the project (landing page)
- Display a list of the existing products, each entry containing product's name, price, image and a "add to cart" button.
- Display a Cart button 

To display list of products:
- use getAll method to get a list of all the products in the products repository
- create a view that will list out all those different products (index)
- get this view to be displayed when a GET request is made to '/'

Clicking the Add to Cart button for a given product will add that product to the cart. Each product can be added multiple times, and that's accounted for in the cart total. Clicking the Cart will allow user to the the cart summary.
