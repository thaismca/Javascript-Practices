This document contains more details about router handlers that deal with products management, for the "Practice Project - E-Commerce App"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>>>> PRODUCTS ROUTER

In this project, in a similar way comparing to what we currently have for User Authentication, we are going to have a file that exports a Router with some route handlers associated with it, that can be wired up to the index.js file.

In order to do that:
- require in Express
- create a new Router
- associate route handlers to this Router
- export the Router

Handlers that we are going to need:
- list all different products
- show a form that allows user to create new product
- submit new product form
- show a form that allows user to edit an existing product
- submit edit product form
- submit product deletion

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>> PRODUCTS LISTING

Displaying the list of products:
- It will be handled as a GET request to '/admin/products'
- Display a list of the existing products, each entry containing product's name, edit button and delete button.
- Display a Create Product button

Clicking the Edit button for a given product will allow user to edit that product.
Clicking the Delete button for a given product will allow user to edit that product.
Clicking the Create Product button will allow user to create a new product.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>> CREATE NEW PRODUCT

Displaying the form to create new product:
- It will be handled as a GET request to '/admin/products/new'
- Display a form where user can submit product name, price and upload an image.

Creating the product:
- It will be handled as a POST request to '/admin/products/new'
- When a new product form is submitted -> validate data -> create a new product
