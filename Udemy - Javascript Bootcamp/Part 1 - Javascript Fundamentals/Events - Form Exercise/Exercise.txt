Create a page to simulate a credit card form.

Page must have a form to receive the following input from user:
- card type: select from visa, mastercard and amex;
- card number: only numbers (15 digits for AMEX and 16 for other types);
- cardholder name: string that is always displayed in upper case and
doesn't accept special characters or numbers;
- expiry date: select month and select year;
- CVV: only numbers (4 digits for AMEX and 3 for other types).

Page must exibith a card-like rectangle, where the card number,
cardholder name, expiry date and cvv number that are displayed are
in sync with what the user is typing in the form below.

Rectangle representing the card must flip to display its front or back,
depending on the input that has focus at the moment. Only cvv for not-AMEX
card are displayed at the back.

Data being typed in the inputs should be displayed with no mask, and
the representation of this data in the card-like rectangle must be
as the following:

- card type selection must change the card logo in the top-right corner;
- card number must be displayed with a mask in some digits, depeding on
the card type (AMEX displaying first four and last five digits and masking
the other six, other types displaying first four and last four digits and
masking the other eight);
- cardholder name must be displayed in upper case, just as in the form input;
- expiry date: date in format MM/YY;
- CVV: display typed data masked with * (AMEX in the front and other types
in the back of the card).

Submit button will only be available once all data is typed, following
the these rules:
- card number and cvv must have all digits typed
- card name cannot be empty 
- expiry date selected and card cannot be expired

Clicking submit will display a "order confirmed" without loading
a new page.
