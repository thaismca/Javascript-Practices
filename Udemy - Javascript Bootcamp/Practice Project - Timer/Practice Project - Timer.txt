This project is part of a practice proposed in the Section 20 of the course.

Things the program does: 1- displays a timer, 2 - shows animated border around the timer

Possible implementation 1
- event listener to watch for a click on 'play' button
- when 'play' is clicked, draw full border around the timer
- each second the timer conts down, update the border  
- each second the timer conts down, update the 'seconds left' text
- when timer reaches 0, reset the boder 
- when timer reaches 0, reset internal timer to get ready for another run

Considering the two thigs that the program does, when checking the steps of the possible implementation 1, we can see every other line of instruction addresses something different inside the application. We alternate at every single line of instruction to handle a different part of the scope of our app. This means that the code can get really hard to understant over time, because we are going to change the context of what we are dealing with as we read every line of code in series. 

So maybe it would be a better approach if we could try and isolate all the different responsibilities of our app into different and separate blocks.

Possible implementation 2 - event style approach
- event listener to watch for a click on 'play' button
- emit an event stating that the timer has started -> watch for this event and, when it occurs, draw the border
- start counting down the timer
- emit an event that the timer has 'ticked' -> watch for this event and, when it occurs, update the border
- each second the timer conts down, update the 'seconds left' text
- if the timer reaches 0
  - emit an event that the timer is done -> watch for this event and, when it occurs, reset the border
  - reset internal timer to get ready for another run

The idea is that, rather than try to write some code where we are alternating what we are doing step by step, and every line of code essentially does something tottaly different and unrelated to what occurred before it, we can instead have one block of code that is completely focused in one aspect of our app, and some other part needs to know about this stuff rather than directly take whatever action on itself inside this one block. For this to work, we would create one solid block that is 100% concerned around the timer, and then that block of code will eventually emit some event, call a callback, or otherwise tell the outside world that something important just occurred.

Class-Based implementation
The idea is to learn how to use a class around DOM Elements.

Class Timer -> 100% corcerned with the timer elements: counter, play button and pause button
This class won't know anything about the animated border around the timer.

Methods in the Timer class will be invoked automatically whenever a user interacts with the timer elements.
play() -> called whenever the user clicks the play button.
pause() -> called whenever the user clicks the pause button.
onDurationChange() -> called whenever the user clicks the duration text and turns it into a text input, so the number can be editted to change the timer duration.
tick() -> called repeatedly over time, as long as the timer is counting down.

constructor -> whenever an instance of Timer is created, references to some DOM elements are going to be passed in to serve as:
- the text input (durationInput)
- the play button (playButton)
- the pause button (pauseButton)

Query selectors are going to be written to find the text input, the play and pause buttons, and those are going to be passed into the constructor, so that the class essentially has a handle ito the DOM. Whwnver it needs to reach into the DOM and do something, it will have those three variables close at hand.
