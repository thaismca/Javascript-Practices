## Course overview

This course is divided into two parts. The first half of the course focuses on teaching the ***basic syntax of Javascript***. Colt walks the student through core topics effortlessly, imparting jewels of JS wisdom along the way.  Included in the first half of the course are many programming exercises and small projects. Each topic is in a separate folder and, although the codes in each of those folder don't really implement a whole program, I decided to keep them in this repository for future references.

The second half of the course is focused on ***building some amazing projects***. Stephen shows students how to build some production-ready Javascript applications, including a fully-featured E-Commerce web app! The main goal of these projects is to highlight design patterns, and show the 'right' and 'wrong' ways of writing code.

***Each project of this second part is contained in a separate folder, each one having its own README file with more details about what was implemented.***

Note that for each project of the second part, all code was implemented (or at least a really good effort was made there) before checking the instructor's solutions. Also, I added a personal challenge to the original scope of each project.
