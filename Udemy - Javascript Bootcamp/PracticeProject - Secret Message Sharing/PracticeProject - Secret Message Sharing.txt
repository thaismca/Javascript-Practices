When a user first comes to the web application, they will encounter a text input and will be prompted to type a message. After inputing text and clicking the Create button, the entire form is going to change and a different content will be displayed. The app will show a new text input containing a URL that the user can copy and share with someone else. When the link is visited, a screen with the message that was submited in the text input will be displayed. Also, there will be a link to create a new message that, when clicked, changes the entire form so that the first screen with the text input is shown.

For styling: use Materialize (http://materializecss.com/)
