Practice Project - Secret Message Sharing

When a user first comes to the web application, they will encounter a text input and will be prompted to type a message. After inputing text and clicking the Create button, the entire form is going to change and a different content will be displayed. The app will show a new text input containing a URL that the user can copy and share with someone else. When the link is visited, a screen with the message that was submited in the text input will be displayed. Also, there will be a link to create a new message that, when clicked, changes the entire form so that the first screen with the text input is shown.

For styling: use Materialize (http://materializecss.com/)


ENCODING AND DECODING MESSAGE:

JavaScript has built-in functions that can handle the message encoding/decoding processes.

The btoa() method creates a Base64-encoded ASCII string from a binary string (i.e., a string in which each character in the string is treated as a byte of binary data). It receives the binary string to encode as argument, and returns an ASCII string containing the Base64 representation of the string that was passed.

You can use this method to encode data which may otherwise cause communication problems, transmit it, then use the atob() method to decode the data again.

The atob() function decodes a string of data which has been encoded using Base64 encoding. It receives a binary string (i.e., a string in which each character in the string is treated as a byte of binary data) containing base64-encoded data, and returns an ASCII string containing decoded data from that encoded string that was passed.

Example:
const encodedData = btoa("Hello, world"); // encode a string
const decodedData = atob(encodedData); // decode the string
