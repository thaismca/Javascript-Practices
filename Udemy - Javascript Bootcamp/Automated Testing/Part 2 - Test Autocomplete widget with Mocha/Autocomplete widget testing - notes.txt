>> OVERVIEW

In this Part 2 of the Automated Testing Section, we are going to:
- use the Mocha testing library to test an Autocomplete widget

This Autocomplete widget was created in the Practice Project - Movie Fight, so the testing code and its documentation will be placed inside that project directory and will be available at https://github.com/thaismca/Learning-Javascript/tree/master/Udemy%20-%20Javascript%20Bootcamp/Practice%20Project%20-%20Movie%20Fight
