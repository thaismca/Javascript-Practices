----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> OVERVIEW

In this Part 3 of the Automated Testing Section, we are going to build a testing framework from scratch: TestMe.

TestMe requirements:
- must be a node-based CLI framework
- must be able to test browser-based JS apps
- must require very little setup
- must be able to test a whole application, not just one little widget
- CLI must have a 'watch mode', so we don't have to keep restarting it over and over
- CLI must automatically find and run all files in our project that have a name of '.test.js
