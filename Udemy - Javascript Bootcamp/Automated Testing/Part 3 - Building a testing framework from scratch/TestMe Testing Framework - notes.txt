This document contains notes about the Part 3 of the Automated Testing section of the Javascript Bootcamp course
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> OVERVIEW

In this Part 3 of the Automated Testing Section, we are going to build a testing framework from scratch: TestMe.

TestMe requirements:
- must be a node-based CLI framework
- must be able to test browser-based JS apps
- must require very little setup
- must be able to test a whole application, not just one little widget
- CLI must have a 'watch mode', so we don't have to keep restarting it over and over
- CLI must automatically find and run all files in our project that have a name of '.test.js

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> PROJECT SETUP
Implementing requirement: must be a node-based CLI framework

1. generate a new package.json file in the project root directory
- run 'npm init -y' in the cmd while in the project root directory

2. create an index.js file in the  project root directory
- this is going to be the essential entry point for the entire application

3. set up to project to run like a CLI tool
- add #!/usr/bin/env node to the top of the index.js file, #!/usr/bin/env node, to tell our computer we want to use Node to execute this file, as opposed to trying to execute this file directly
- set index.js to be executed from anywhere on our machine, by adding a command that runs the index.js file to a new bin section, in the package.json file
- run 'npm link' while in the project root directory

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

1. File Collection
CLI must automatically find and run all files in our project that have a name of '.test.js. So, whenever we run our command line tool, we have to take a look at the project directory that the command line tool is being executed from and find all the different test files inside of this project directory.

2. Test Environment Setup
Once we have then collected all those different files, we have to do some environment setup before we run any tests. We need to make sure that we can somehow execute those files, and make sure that they have the ability to have some browser-based JavaScript code inside them.

3. Test File Execution
Once we do that environment set up, then actually execute each test file, running each little 'it' statement, one by one at a time, and watch for any errors that might occur.

4. Report Results
Once we've collected all the results from all these different tests, we need to tabulate all that data and print out the results to the terminal so that the developer who is using the tool understands what test failed and what test actually passed.

>> RUNNER.JS

This file is going to contain a bunch of code related to the entire process of:

- Find all files ending in '*.test.js' recursively through a folder
- Store a reference to each file we find
- After getting a full list of the test files, execute them one by one

Note: the actual test environment setup will be inside of a different file.

In order to organize our code, we are going to use a class to group together all this functionality, and then export that class so it can be available to other files inside of this project.

> constructor: will contain an instance variable that's going to store a reference to every file that we discover.

> collectFiles: method that implements a modified breadth first search to iterate recursively through a folder, find all files ending in '*.test.js', and store a reference to each file that is found. It taked an argumetn of targetPath, which going to be the entire absolute path to some folder that we want to investigate on our local machine.

Modified breadth search: normally, a breadth search would take all children from an element in a tree and add them to an array. Then start to iterate through the array, take a look at each individual item, and for each item find all of its children and add them all to the array. This process would continue until all elements of the tree were finally added to that array.

In this application, we're going to add these children into this array to iterate over only if they are folders. Files with .test.js extension are going to be added to the array that keeps track of all of the different test files (this.testFiles). And if it's not a test file or a folder, then we're basically just going to ignore it.
