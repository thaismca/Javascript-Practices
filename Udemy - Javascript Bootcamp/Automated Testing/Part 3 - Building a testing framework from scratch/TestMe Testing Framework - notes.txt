This document contains notes about the Part 3 of the Automated Testing section of the Javascript Bootcamp course
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> OVERVIEW

In this Part 3 of the Automated Testing Section, we are going to build a testing framework from scratch: TestMe.

TestMe requirements:
- must be a node-based CLI framework
- must be able to test browser-based JS apps
- must require very little setup
- must be able to test a whole application, not just one little widget
- CLI must have a 'watch mode', so we don't have to keep restarting it over and over
- CLI must automatically find and run all files in our project that have a name of '.test.js

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> PROJECT SETUP
Implementing requirement: must be a node-based CLI framework

1. generate a new package.json file in the project root directory
- run 'npm init -y' in the cmd while in the project root directory

2. create an index.js file in the  project root directory
- this is going to be the essential entry point for the entire application

3. set up to project to run like a CLI tool
- add #!/usr/bin/env node to the top of the index.js file, #!/usr/bin/env node, to tell our computer we want to use Node to execute this file, as opposed to trying to execute this file directly
- set index.js to be executed from anywhere on our machine, by adding a command that runs the index.js file to a new bin section, in the package.json file
- run 'npm link' while in the project root directory
